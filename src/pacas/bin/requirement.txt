Requirement:

1. Add special folder substitution support in deploy config and other trans components.
E.g., %USER_HOME% stands for c:\documents and settings\xxxxx
%WIN_PATH% stands for the windows installed dir 

2. Note that the best way to make loading of w32helper.dll is to copy it to system32 folder.
Because when running with RFT's run, the mods to user.library.path won't work.
