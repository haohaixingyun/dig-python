This package contains base states that you can use. A base state is called before (or after) a testcase runs in order to set the application under test to a base starting condition so that the next testcase can proceed from scratch without problems. Otherwise, if one testcase fails and e.g. leaves a dialog open, the next testcase to run may fail too since it wouldn't expect the dialog to be open. To avoid such problems, call one of these base states before every testcase.
