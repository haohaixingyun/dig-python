This package contains widget classes that extend the functionality of Rational's TestObject hierarchy.<p> 
They make it easier to write code that manipulates GUI objects on the screen. 
The preferred method for using these objects is to create a new instance from either a mapped or a dynamically located object, like so:
<code>
<dd>WButton myButton = new WButton(Button_MappedName());</code><br>
OR
<dd><code>WButton myButton = new WButton(sButtonName, sProperty, sClass, BrowserPage());</code><br>
and then use it with the non-static methods, e.g.<br>
<dd><code>myButton.click()</code><p>
Note that since these classes inherit functionality from their corresponding Rational's TestObject classes, you can use all the methods available from these classes on the widgets.
Thus, you will not lose any functionality by using the widgets. For example, you can also call:
<dd><code>myButton.drag(pt1, pt2)</code><p>
